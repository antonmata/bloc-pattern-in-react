# Using BLoC Pattern in React

A demo application showing a sample implementation of the BLoC pattern in React.

## How to run

### Install dependencies

```cmd
yarn
```

### Start the application

```cmd
yarn start
```

## Setup

A _Counter_ component's state is implemented in 4 different ways:

- Using the State object
- Using MobX
- Using Subject from RxJS
- Using the BLoC pattern

## Intention

This demo is intended to show how the _BLoC pattern_ (a pattern specifically for Flutter) differs from other methods. The syntax of Dart can be a bit hard to understand due to the syntax noise (as compared to JSX), so implementing it in React might allow for a different perspective in understanding the BLoC pattern.
